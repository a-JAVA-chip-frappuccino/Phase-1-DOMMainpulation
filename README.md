# Phase 1 Lecture 2: DOM Manipulation

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to grab elements from the DOM and change their appearance. You will also know how to create and remove elements.

## Lesson Plan

1. Take a look at the HTML page to familiarize yourself with it. ✅
    - What do the elements resemble? Why is this referred to as a **tree**?
    - What is the **Document Object Model**?
    - What is the `defer` line doing in the `<script>` tag?
2. Grab the `<h1>` tag from the DOM and change its color. ✅
    - What are the different ways to grab the tag?
3. Grab the `<p>` tag from the DOM and replace its filler text with real text. ✅
    - What is the difference between `innerHTML` and `textContent`?
4. Create a list of 5 numbers and add them to the `<ol>` tag. ✅
    - How do you know which tag to use?
    - What is the difference between `append` and `appendChild`?
    - Can you make this list more efficiently?
5. Remove the final `<p>` tag from the page. ✅

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will continue our work with the DOM, adding in ways to dynamically change the DOM using event listeners.
